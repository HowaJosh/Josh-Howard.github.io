# Projects

This section will house my data science and analytics projects. Over the coming months I'll populate this page with exploratory data analyses, predictive models, dashboards and other original work. For now, here are a few ideas I'm exploring:

- **Financial dashboard:** an interactive tool for visualising key performance metrics for a credit union.
- **Fraud detection model:** using classification algorithms to identify anomalous transactions.
- **Sales forecasting:** employing time‑series analysis to predict future revenue trends.
